Text-to-Image Generation with Stable Diffusion
This repository contains code for generating images based on text prompts using the Stable Diffusion model. The code leverages the diffusers and transformers libraries to load pre-trained models and generate images from user-provided text descriptions.

Features
Stable Diffusion Integration: Utilizes the Stable Diffusion model for high-quality image generation.
Configurable Settings: Easily adjust image generation parameters such as the number of inference steps, image size, and guidance scale.
GPU Acceleration: Supports CUDA for faster image generation.
Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or higher
diffusers library
transformers library
torch with CUDA support (optional but recommended)


You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

pip install --upgrade diffusers transformers torch
